Single threaded means that our program is only using one thread of execution to perform the tasks

JavaScript/Node Js is a single threaded application. It means it only uses one thread to execute the all tasks.

Other programming languages such as java, c++, golang are multi threaded.

Example:

A simple Js program

processPayment(); // takes 1 second to complete 

invoiceGenerate(); // takes 3 second to complete, this is a blocking call 

sendEmail(); // this won't be executed until the thread executes the above task which is taking 3 seconds to complete

But why Node Js is fast despite of single threaded architecture ?

It uses event loop for async operation to let the other tasks be completed if one task is taking too much time. -> Event Loop
