Event loop(Semi Infinite - stops when there is no other work to do) is the reason of Node Js performance. It executes the non-blocking operations. 

Understanding it:

global() is the base of the call stack - like main

Important: 
Node.js executes JavaScript code within a single thread of its Event Loop, making it appear single-threaded. However, it achieves concurrency and efficiency through non-blocking I/O operations managed by libuv and provides the ability to leverage multiple threads for CPU-bound tasks using worker_threads
4 threads by default in worker threads

The two module systems in Node.js:
Type	Syntax	File Extension	Compatibility
CommonJS	require() / module.exports	.js (default)	Traditional Node.js
ES Modules (ESM)	import / export	.mjs or with "type": "module"	Modern JavaScript
